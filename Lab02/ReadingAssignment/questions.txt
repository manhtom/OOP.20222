- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: NO.
In Java, there's something called method overloading - we can create multiple constructors with different parameter lists (different method signatures) in the same class.
However, in this case, the constructor method to build
a DVD by category will have the same number of arguments (1) as the constructor method to build a DVD by title - and that sole argument also has the same datatype (String). Therefore its method signature will be identical to the constructor to build a DVD by title, regardless of the different parameter name. Java does not allow methods with the same method signature to co-exist.
