9. Constructors of whole classes and parent classes
- Which classes are aggregates of other classes? 

Store and Cart are aggregates of Book, DigitalVideoDisc and CompactDisc.
CompactDisc is an aggregate of Track.

10. Unique item in a cart

- When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class, you
must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes as the
above requirements (i.e. id for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is not
an instance of Media, what happens?

A ClassCastException will be raised. To avoid this, we can use the instanceof method to check if the passing object is an instance of Media or not.

12. Sort media in the cart

Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the
Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the
information of this interface.

Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.

1. What class should implement the Comparable interface?

The Media class.

2. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we
want?

We compare the two attributes of the object: title and cost.

3. Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?

No. The compareTo method can only implement a single ordering rule.

4. Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing
length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?

We will utilize method overriding for compareTo in the DigitalVideoDisc class.
